# KGS-Global on Blockchain
The Koh-e-Noor Diamond is known for its beauty and royalty. The token will be native to the educational venture of Knowledge Gateway Schools (Global) which started telling the world about the four stars of the future in 2019. Yes, before Google and any other technology giant, it was KGS that started training and running awareness campaigns regarding the combo of top four technologies which will transfor the future. The four technologies are Blockchain, Metaverse, Web 3, and Artificial Intelligence combined to reshape future of the world. KGS was the first school to teach the pack containing combo of these four and produced gems which it called Koh-e-Noor. The token is our recognition of the combo and a contribution to the mother technology i.e Blockchain.
Knowledge Gateway School is a revolutionary platform where students enter to learn and earn from day one.
Reason for establishment of KGS by Prof. Ahmad Bilal Khan:
Watching University Graduates looking for jobs years after passing out has always been a sunless landscape. Here in Pakistan and in the like countries, thousands of medical doctors, PhDs, and engineers are jobless and millions of graduates are compulsively doing odd jobs for a living. What is missing? Why our system of education has failed so miserably over the past three decades to equip the degree holders with most essential skills to live with financial freedom? After years of research, an answer was found and thus the grand project was initiated by the founder.

Knowledge Gateway 'Earning' School is the most prestigious project of Knowledge Gateway Schools; a unique initiative taken by an educationist cum social worker with a vision to enable youth across the globe to learn the ways to earn while studying, serving and/or doing business.

Knowledge Gateway School is a registered business with Securities & Exchange Commission of Pakistan and maintaining a business account with Habib Bank Limited.

KGES has an expert panel of mentors; accomplished and thoroughly professional. The school facilitates one on one connection between the mentor and the mentee(student) and moderates the process of skills development in a thoroughly practical setting.

"We ensure that the learner becomes the earner from Day One because Skills will definitely take some time to develop and play."

Custom tailored Skills are inculcated which are most essential to acquire before seekers start earning a handsome living through providing services, trading and/or business operations. The services are available to everyone but our primal focus remains the youth (age group: 14 to 25).

KGES is not offering conventional education. The school binds the mentor and the mentee in an agreement of business partnership based on Shariah Compliant 'Modharba'. Skills of the Mentor practically come into play under observation of the mentee. The Mentor manages funds for the mentee by employing world's most sophisticated Portfolio Management Plan on Hybrid Trading Platforms (HTP). Security is provided on top by Knowledge Gateway. The purpose is to watch and experience the growth of funds as the mentee learns and gives his input and feedback to the mentor as assessment of his skills. Mentor then rates and decides for success of the mentee.

After completing the set of modules, the mentee becomes a mentor and starts training the mentees. The chain thus formed strengthens with each passing out batch and brings to the world financial freedom via Islamically proposed model of partnership.
Knowledge Gateway has the honor of being the Global Pioneers in this discipline by the supreme grace of Allah.
